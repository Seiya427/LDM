# LDM
A latent diffusion model architecture using pytorch
```
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib keyboard transformers numpy pillow tqdm einops
```
Makes an image with a text prompt and displays it in matplotlib. Works like a scaled down version of StableDiffusion, but still complex enough to make various images.
> [!NOTE]
> This model is very large so will take a long time to train, and needs a lot of processing power to do so.
